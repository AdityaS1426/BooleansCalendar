# BooleansCalendar

## Summary

With this Calendar application, users can schedule events by designating a specific date to be notified of the event, writing a description of the event, & setting a specific time to be notified of the event. The user will be notified of the events via their smartphone or by e-mail. May add functionality by linking it to canvas.

## Team SMART Goals for Mini Review #1

###### SMART Goal 1

S - The Booleans will create a basic template for their website, with a home page set up with a background image, logo, buttons, text, etc. by March 26, 2021. Creating a template will allow for a basis to build off of while furthering the development of the intended Calendar Application.

M - The goal will be achieved if the Home Page successfully opens on LocalHost with the intended format. The intended background image, logo, buttons, & text should be clearly visible, & the format should be appealing.

A - This goal will be achieved via the use of HTML, CSS, & Java knowledge in conjunction with the IntelliJ IDEA development interface. Websites were developed in the previous Tri, so this goal is very achievable.

R - The goal is very realistic, especially with work put in from every team member. Most of the knowledge used to create the Home Page is from prior experience, so this goal is extremely realistic.

T - This goal should be achieved by March 26, 2021.

###### SMART Goal 2

S - The Booleans will make sure their website is deployed by March 26 2021, even if the CSS formatting is not visible. The CSS formatting will be taken care of by the next checkpoint. The Booleans will utilize Heroku for deployment, as it's the simplest method. Ensuring the website is deployed is a simple goal, but it's essential for further progress, as the deployed website can be checked routinely to measure progress.

M - The goal will be achieved if the website is readily accessible via the public through the use of the URL.

A - This goal is definitely achievable, as prior experience has allowed for the knowledge necessary to easily deploy the website.

R - This goal is realistic, as the presence of a GitHub repository with working code is all that's necessary for deployment on Heroku.

T - This goal should be achieved by March 26, 2021.

###### SMART Goal 3

S - The Booleans will start working on their Recursion Mini Lab, with the basic logic completed by March 26, 2021. If the basic logic is outlined, it will be much easier to work around the logic to establish the "view" that's part of the MVC framework. As a result, the Mini Lab will make its presence on the website at a late date, preferably by April 2, 2021.

M - If the recursion-based Factorial Program is able to be run successfully in IntelliJ IDEA, this goal will be achieved.

A - This goal will be achievable, as it's simply the basis of the Mini Lab, which will be furthered next week.

R - This goal is very realistic, as the Tech Talk on Thursday, March 25, 2021 provided quite a bit of insight regarding the approach necessary to complete this Mini Lab.

T - This goal should be achieved by March 26, 2021.
